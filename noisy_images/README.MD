# Add noisy data

This folder contains the scripts necessary for doing the experiments which are related to adding noisy images. They can be added to both training and validation (experiment 2) or only to validation dataset (experiment 3)


All the necessary functions and classes are located in functions.py. However, in order for the notebook to be tracable, some of the functions are rewritten in the notebook as well.
