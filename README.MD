# Automating the Segmentation of X-ray Images with Deep Neural Networks

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMxKpqAaCvl8HerptL11VeUZVjKSUzYJ/view?usp=sharing`.

## Experiments
We conducted 4 experiments as part of this project. The notebooks, scripts and steps required for each experiment can be found in their respective folders as part the python notebook and as README files. (Experiment 1 can be found in Exp1_baseline, experiments 2 & 3 are located in Exp2_3_noisy_images & experiment 4 is in Exp4_variation_in_training_dataset). The variation in dataset size experiment was run on the HPC, while the rest were run using Google Colab.
