# Automating the Segmentation of X-ray Images with Deep Neural Networks

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMxKpqAaCvl8HerptL11VeUZVjKSUzYJ/view?usp=sharing`.

## Experiments
We conducted 4 experiments as part of this project. The notebooks, scripts and steps required for each experiment can be found in their respective folders as part the python notebook and as README files. The first three experiments were run on Google Colab and the last one was run on DTU's HPC cluster.

* Baseline experiment -> `baseline/`
* Experiments 2 and 3 - Adding Noise -> `noisy_images/`
* Experiment 4 - Adjusting training set size -> `variation_in_training_dataset/`
